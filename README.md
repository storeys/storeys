Storeys is a client-side JavaScript framework for developing maintainable web applications.

Storeys is web ready: supports webpages served entirely by web servers. It is highly scalable as most of its content can be served as static assets.

Storeys is also hybrid-mobile-app ready: an entire app can be stored in the local filesystem or packaged with Phonegap (Cordova), accessing RESTful web API.

Storeys is pro-isomorphic: supports server-side web frameworks such as Python Django (or other framework for JinJa) as well as being used as a SPF (Structured Page Fragment) library.
